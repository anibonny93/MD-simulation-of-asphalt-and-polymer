MARTINI_Asphalt_Polymer_buildscript_2025.m is a all-in-one CG structure creator that work for specified config files of components mentioned in the code. 

To run this code in its entirety, the *.lmp and *_config.m files of all molecules are required. The config files are given in the config_files folder. A molecule config.m file will contain
the beadlist. Each row of the beadlist contain the atoms that are in a specific bead. For example, in TIR_oxi_config.m file, which signifies the oxidized Thio-oxirenieratane, 

[33 34 35 92 93 94 95 96 97 0 0 ] signifies the atom ids, the beadtype row showcases the beadtypes of that particular group of atoms, in this case which is RC3. This Bead association is consistent with 
MARITNI 3 force field model. 

- The bonds section assigns how each bead is connected to other beads.
- The angle section assigns the angles between 3 beads.
- The dihedral sections assigns angles between 4 beads.
- The bond, angle, and dihedral coeffs are generated by asphaltCG_make_LAMMPS.m file. The masses signify the combined masses of the group of atoms in a particular bead.
- The pos signifies position based on the the center of mass of the group of atoms.
